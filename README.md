# Kickstarting with Excel
## Analizing Kickstarter data to find trends
### Purpose
To determine the success of Kickstarter projects in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To determine how launch date effects the success of a kick starter I first created a pivot table on the new sheet “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date”. The Pivot table broke down theater Kickstarters by the month they were launched and the outcome. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
