# Kickstarting with Excel
## Analizing Kickstarter data to find trends
### Purpose
To determine the success of Kickstarter projects in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To determine how launch date effects the success of a kick starter I first created a pivot table on the new sheet “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date”. The Pivot table broke down theater Kickstarters by the month they were launched and the outcome.

From the pivot table I created a line graph of the outcomes throughout a year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To Analyze how the target goal for the Kickstarter effected the success rate I broke the goal down into the following ranges.

I then populated the ranges by the outcomes of Kickstarter plays. To populate the ranges, I used the COUNTIF function. I filtered the Kickstarters by the range of the goal, the outcome and the subcategory “plays”. From here I tallied up all the outcome and then calculated the percentage for the outcomes.

Using this table I created the following line graph.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Results
- What
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
